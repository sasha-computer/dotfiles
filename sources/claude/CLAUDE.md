# Global Context

Shell: fish | OS: NixOS | Shebangs: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

Prefer `gh` CLI for GitHub. Use Context7 MCP for library docs.

## CLAUDE.md Style
Keep CLAUDE.md files minimal. Include only: commands, essential constraints, non-discoverable info. Omit directory structures, file lists, and patterns the agent can explore.
